Stylish script for kitsu.io with dark colors.

Be sure to have Stylish (or another CSS styler) installed from the [Firefox Addons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/?src=external-userstyleshome) or [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe).

Copy paste into a new user style.

I have not decided whether to post this to userstyles.org.
